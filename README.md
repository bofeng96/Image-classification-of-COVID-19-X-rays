# Image-classification-of-COVID-19-X-rays

The data we will use has been collected by Adrian Xu, combining the Kaggle Chest X-ray dataset with the COVID-19 Chest X-ray dataset collected by Dr. Joseph Paul Cohen of the University of Montreal.


Task1: Train a deep neural network model to classify normal vs. COVID-19 Xrays

Task2: Train a deep neural network model to classify an X-ray image into one of the following classes: normal, COVID-19, Pneumonia-Bacterial, and Pneumonia-Viral

After training, visualize features of training data by reducing their dimensionality to 2 using t-SNE.
